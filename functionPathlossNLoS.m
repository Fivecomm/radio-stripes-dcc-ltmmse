function pathloss = functionPathlossNLoS(W,h,h_AP,h_AT,fc,d)
% Estimate the path loss baed on the "NLoS" propagation models (urban,
% suburban, rural) specified in [1].
%
% INPUT:
%   W           = Street width (m)
%   h           = Average building height (m)
%   h_AP        = AP antenna height (m)
%   h_AT        = UE AT antenna height (m)
%   fc          = carrier frequency (GHz)
%   d           = distance between transmitter and receiver antenna (m)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   pathloss    = path loss (large-scale fading coefficient) (dB)
